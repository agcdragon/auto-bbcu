# auto-bbcu
I wrote a python script to auto-login and auto-logoff BBCollab for TJ students during virtual school, so that students don't forget to login/logoff.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/agcdragon/auto-bbcu.git`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit `autologin.py` and insert your own BBCU links and lunch blocks
4. Run with `python autologin.py`

Note: Make sure in power settings, the screen does not turn off by choosing the "Never" option
